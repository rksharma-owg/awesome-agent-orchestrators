# Awesome Agent Orchestrators [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of tools and frameworks for orchestrating agents.

Everything here decides what an agent works on, when it runs, where it runs, or what happens to its output, and takes whatever task you point it at. Single-purpose bots, and things an agent merely consumes — memory backends, MCP servers, sandbox providers, skill libraries — are out of scope.

## How to choose

- **Run several agents at once and review each diff.** [Terminal](#parallel-coding-agents--terminal-tuicli) if you live in tmux, [Desktop & Web](#parallel-coding-agents--desktop--web) if you want a GUI or phone access.
- **Keep an agent working while you're away.** [Autonomous Loop Runners](#autonomous-loop-runners) drive one goal until it verifies. [Autonomous Task Runners](#autonomous-task-runners) pull work from an issue tracker, board, or schedule.
- **Have agents split a large job between themselves.** [Multi-Agent Swarms](#multi-agent-swarms).
- **Message an agent instead of opening a tool.** [Personal Assistants](#personal-assistants) stay running, remember across sessions, and pick up work from a chat thread — general tasks, not only code.
- **Build your own orchestrator.** [Agent Infrastructure & Primitives](#agent-infrastructure--primitives) — control planes, coordination protocols, harness adapters, and runtimes.

## Parallel Coding Agents — Terminal (TUI/CLI)

Run and supervise several agent sessions side by side from a terminal — tmux panes, git worktrees, and TUI dashboards.

- [agent-console](https://github.com/buhuipao/agent-console) - Rust TUI that finds Codex and Claude Code sessions from the providers' own transcripts, including ones started elsewhere, and resumes their native UI rather than replacing it. No tmux or worktrees.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
- The tool or framework orchestrates coding or general-purpose autonomous agents.
- Single-purpose bots, memory stores, and MCP tools should be added only if they include native agent orchestration loops.
- Links point directly to the open-source repository or active project homepage.
- Entries are added in alphabetical order under their respective section.

### Format

```markdown
- [name](https://github.com/org/repo) - Short description highlighting orchestration model, supported agents, and distinctive capabilities.
